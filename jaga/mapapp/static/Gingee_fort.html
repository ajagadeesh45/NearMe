        <h1>Gingee Fort</h1>
        <p>
            The fort was originally built by Kone rulers around the 9th century and later improved by the Vijayanagar kings in the 13th century. 
            After that, it was ruled by many others — the Marathas, Mughals, French, and British.<br><br>
            Because of its strength, the great Maratha king Shivaji called it the “Troy of the East.”
